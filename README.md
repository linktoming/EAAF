# EAAF
Enterprise AI Adoption Framework (EAAF) captures my thoughts on enterprise AI adoption with contributions and references from the AI community, and of course, the AIs themselves. 

The thought process focuses on how an enterprise could think on the adoption of AI **internally**. We think from the perspective of **enterprises as the end users** rather than the producers of the AI applications. It also covers the scenarios where enterprises build AI applications for internal use, with or without the help of 3rd parties.

# Layers of Enterprise AI Adoption
- **Ready-to-use AI Apps**  
  The enterprises should start from here as this path has the highest ROI and least-needed effort. Enterprises and app producers should work together to solve data security concerns if any. It should be a solvable problem and a much easier problem than building an equally-effective AI app internally.
