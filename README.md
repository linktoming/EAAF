# EAAF
Enterprise AI Adoption Framework (EAAF) captures my thoughts on enterprise AI adoption with contributions and references from the AI community, and of course, the AIs themselves. 

To simplify the thought process, we focus from the perspective of **enterprises as the end users** rather than the producers of the AI applications. It clarifies how an enterprise could think on the adoption of AI **internally**. 

# Layers of Enterprise AI Adoption
- Ready-to-use AI Apps
- Leverage AI/ML Platforms to build internal AI projects
- Build internal AI projects from scratch
